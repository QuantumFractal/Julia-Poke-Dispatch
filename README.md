# Julia-Poke-Dispatch
Code for ["Julia used Multiple Dispatch! It was Super Effective!"](https://www.moll.dev/projects/effective-multi-dispatch/) article.

I decided to write a small package for people to play with. Enjoy!

Usage:
```julia
using PokeTypes
import PokeTypes.eff

type MyNewPokeType <: PokÃ©Type end

eff(atk::MyNewPokeType, def::Water) = PokeTypes.NOT_VERY_EFFECTIVE

PokeTypes.attack(MyNewPokeType(), Water())
```
